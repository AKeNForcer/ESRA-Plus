# ESRA-Plus

Understanding the connections between their queries and the search results presented is crucial in the scientific domain. Our previous system, ESRA, aimed to create these connections by outlining query-related topics and explaining the connections between queries and abstracts. However, it relied on only a keyword search and a computationally expensive knowledge graph. In this paper, we present ESRA+, an enhanced version of ESRA that improves the existing features and new features complementing our existing features using Question Answering and Semantic Search approaches. The systemâ€™s existing features now include the ability to perform semantic search, provide an explanation with the contribution of the specific paper of interest, and present a fact list of enti- ties related directly to the user query. The new features allow the system to recommend papers and queries and provide an overview of the query-related topic. The system has been fully redesigned and implemented. Human evaluations have shown that ESRA+ outperforms other baselines and achieves high satisfaction. The ESRA+ web application is publicly available at http://esra.cp.eng.chula.ac.th.

## Running ESRA+
To deploy and run ESRA+ System locally, we recommend you use Docker to deploy the system by follow the steps below.

1. Download "gpl-model.zip" and "explain-model.zip".

2. Unzip "gpl-model.zip" to "./esra-search/pipelines/gpl/".

3. Unzip "explain-model.zip" to "./esra-explain-worker/models/".

4. Config "docker-compose.yml" to have the number of explain-worker you want.

This is the example of and 2 explain-worker. Each worker is running at each GPU.

docker-compose.yml
```yml
  explain-worker-0:
    image: esra-explain-worker
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./esra-explain-worker/models/:/esra/models/
    environment:
      DEVICE: 'cuda:0'
      MAIN_ELASTICSEARCH_HOST: tcp://172.18.0.6:9200
      MAIN_ELASTICSEARCH_USER: elastic
      MAIN_ELASTICSEARCH_PASS: esra_CP44
      BACKEND_URL: http://backend:3001/
      MONGODB_URI: mongodb://esra:esra@mongo_mongo_1:27017/?authMechanism=DEFAULT
      EXPIRE_DURATION: 300000
      PORT: 5559
    networks:
      - esra
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
          -  driver: nvidia
             count: all
             capabilities: [gpu]
  explain-worker-1:
    image: esra-explain-worker
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./esra-explain-worker/models/:/esra/models/
    environment:
      DEVICE: 'cuda:1'
      MAIN_ELASTICSEARCH_HOST: tcp://172.18.0.6:9200
      MAIN_ELASTICSEARCH_USER: elastic
      MAIN_ELASTICSEARCH_PASS: esra_CP44
      BACKEND_URL: http://backend:3001/
      MONGODB_URI: mongodb://esra:esra@mongo_mongo_1:27017/?authMechanism=DEFAULT
      EXPIRE_DURATION: 300000
      PORT: 5559
    networks:
      - esra
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
          -  driver: nvidia
             count: all
             capabilities: [gpu]
  explain-controller:
    image: esra-explain-controller
    restart: always
    environment:
      WORKERS_URL: '"http://explain-worker-0:5559/","http://explain-worker-1:5559/"'
      WORK_LIMIT: 2
      PORT: 5559
    networks:
      - esra
    links:
      - explain-worker-0
      - explain-worker-1
```

5. Config "docker-compose.yml" and "load-balancer/nginx.conf" to have the number of search-worker you want.

This is the example of and 2 explain-worker. Each worker is running at each GPU.

docker-compose.yml
```yml
  search-0:
    image: esra-search
    restart: always
    environment:
      MAIN_ELASTICSEARCH_HOST: tcp://172.18.0.6:9200
      MAIN_ELASTICSEARCH_USER: elastic
      MAIN_ELASTICSEARCH_PASS: esra_CP44
      DEVICE: 'cuda:0'
      BM25_SIZE: 100
      GPL_TSDAE_SIZE: 100
      USE_GPL_TSDAE_COMPLETION: 'no'
    volumes:
      - ./esra-search/pipelines/gpl/:/esra/pipelines/gpl/
    networks:
      - esra
      - esra-db-es
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
          -  driver: nvidia
             count: all
             capabilities: [gpu]
  search-1:
    image: esra-search
    restart: always
    environment:
      MAIN_ELASTICSEARCH_HOST: tcp://172.18.0.6:9200
      MAIN_ELASTICSEARCH_USER: elastic
      MAIN_ELASTICSEARCH_PASS: esra_CP44
      DEVICE: 'cuda:1'
      BM25_SIZE: 100
      GPL_TSDAE_SIZE: 100
      USE_GPL_TSDAE_COMPLETION: 'no'
    volumes:
      - ./esra-search/pipelines/gpl/:/esra/pipelines/gpl/
    networks:
      - esra
      - esra-db-es
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
          -  driver: nvidia
             count: all
             capabilities: [gpu]
  search-load-balancer:
    image: esra-search-load-balancer
    links:
      - search-0
      - search-1
    restart: always
    networks:
      - esra
```

load-balancer/nginx.conf
```conf
upstream search {
    server search-1:5000;
    server search-0:5000;
}
server {
    listen 80;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://search/;
    }
}
```

6. Build and depoly system by run following command and wait for a while.

```sh
sh cd.sh
```

7. Now you can access the ESRA+ Web Application via http://localhost:6680/
